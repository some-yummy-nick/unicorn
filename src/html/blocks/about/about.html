    <p class="section__text">The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening meal at home in the
      living room that was used by everyone, and so the door to this room was often kept closed in the evening. But
      Gregor found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all, often failed to make use of it when it
      was open and, without the family having noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner. One time, though, the
      charwoman left the door.</p>
